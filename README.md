#Accelerometer_MC3672

Arduino Accelerometer sensor driver for mCube Product MC3672.
==============================================================

The MC3672 is an ultra-low power, low noise, integrated digital output 3-axis accelerometer with a feature set optimized for wearables and consumer product motion sensing. Applications include wearable consumer products, IoT devices, user interface control, gaming motion input, electronic compass tilt compensation for cell phones, game controllers, remote controls and portable media products. Low noise and low power are inherent in the monolithic fabrication approach, where the MEMS accelerometer is integrated in a single-chip with the electronics integrated circuit.
